# Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis

This repository provides code and resources for fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sentiment analysis tasks. BERT is a natural language processing model that can be fine-tuned on specific tasks like sentiment classification.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text, such as a review, comment, or tweet. This repository demonstrates how to leverage the power of BERT to build a sentiment classifier.
